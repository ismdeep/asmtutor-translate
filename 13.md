## Lesson 13

#### Calculator - subtraction


In this program we will be subtracting the value in the register EBX from the value in the register EAX.  Firstly we load EAX and EBX with integers in the same way as Lesson 12.  The only difference is we will be using the SUB instruction to perform our subtraction logic, leaving our answer in the left most register of this instruction (in our case EAX). Then all we need to do is call our integer printing function to complete the program.

calculator-subtraction.asm
```
; Calculator (Subtraction)
; Compile with: nasm -f elf calculator-subtraction.asm
; Link with (64 bit systems require elf_i386 option): ld -m elf_i386 calculator-subtraction.o -o calculator-subtraction
; Run with: ./calculator-subtraction

%include        'functions.asm'

SECTION .text
global  _start

_start:

    mov     eax, 90     ; move our first number into eax
    mov     ebx, 9      ; move our second number into ebx
    sub     eax, ebx    ; subtract ebx from eax
    call    iprintLF    ; call our integer print with linefeed function

    call    quit
```

```
~$ nasm -f elf calculator-subtraction.asm
~$ ld -m elf_i386 calculator-subtraction.o -o calculator-subtraction
~$ ./calculator-subtraction
81
