#### Process Forking


##### 基础知识

In this lesson we will use SYS_FORK to create a new process that duplicates our current process.  SYS_FORK takes no arguments - you just call fork and the new process is created.  Both processes run concurrently. We can test the return value (in eax) to test whether we are currently in the parent or child process.  The parent process returns a non-negative, non-zero integer.  In the child process EAX is zero.  This can be used to branch your logic between the parent and child.

In our program we exploit this fact to print out different messages in each process.

Note:
Each process is responsible for safely exiting.


fork.asm
```asm
; Fork
; Compile with: nasm -f elf fork.asm
; Link with (64 bit systems require elf_i386 option): ld -m elf_i386 fork.o -o fork
; Run with: ./fork

%include        'functions.asm'

SECTION .data
childMsg        db      'This is the child process', 0h     ; a message string
parentMsg       db      'This is the parent process', 0h    ; a message string

SECTION .text
global  _start

_start:

    mov     eax, 2              ; invoke SYS_FORK (kernel opcode 2)
    int     80h

    cmp     eax, 0              ; if eax is zero we are in the child process
    jz      child               ; jump if eax is zero to child label

parent:
    mov     eax, parentMsg      ; inside our parent process move parentMsg into eax
    call    sprintLF            ; call our string printing with linefeed function

    call    quit                ; quit the parent process

child:
    mov     eax, childMsg       ; inside our child process move childMsg into eax
    call    sprintLF            ; call our string printing with linefeed function

    call    quit                ; quit the child process
```


```
~$ nasm -f elf fork.asm
~$ ld -m elf_i386 fork.o -o fork
~$ ./fork
This is the parent process
This is the child process
```
