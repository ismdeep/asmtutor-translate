那如果我们想要输出一个我们不知道长度的字符串，该怎么办呢？比如用户输入。学习一下循环、标签和指针计算。

#### 计算字符串长度

##### 基础知识

为什么我们需要计算字符串的长度？

当我们调用sys_write的时候，sys_write需要两个参数，一个是内存中我们需要输出的字符串的指针，另一个是我们需要输出的这个字符串的长度。于是，当我们改动了这个字符串的内容的时候，我们对应的需要修改传给sys_write的长度参数，否则就不能正常输出。



You can see what I mean using the program in Lesson 2.  Modify the message string to say 'Hello, brave new world!' then compile, link and run the new program.  The output will be 'Hello, brave ' (the first 13 characters) because we are still only passing 13 bytes to sys_write as its length.  It will be particularly necessary when we want to print out user input.  As we won't know the length of the data when we compile our program, we will need a way to calculate the length at runtime in order to successfully print it out.

##### 编写程序

To calculate the length of the string we will use a technique called pointer arithmetic.  Two registers are initialised pointing to the same address in memory.  One register (in this case EAX) will be incremented forward one byte for each character in the output string until we reach the end of the string.  The original pointer will then be subtracted from EAX.  This is effectively like subtraction between two arrays and the result yields the number of elements between the two addresses. This result is then passed to sys_write replacing our hard coded count.

The CMP instruction compares the left hand side against the right hand side and sets a number of flags that are used for program flow.  The flag we're checking is the ZF or Zero Flag.  When the byte that EAX points to is equal to zero the ZF flag is set.  We then use the JZ instruction to jump, if the ZF flag is set, to the point in our program labeled 'finished'. This is to break out of the nextchar loop and continue executing the rest of the program.

helloworld-len.asm

```asm
; Hello World Program (Calculating string length)
; Compile with: nasm -f elf helloworld-len.asm
; Link with (64 bit systems require elf_i386 option): ld -m elf_i386 helloworld-len.o -o helloworld-len
; Run with: ./helloworld-len

SECTION .data
msg     db      'Hello, brave new world!', 0Ah ; we can modify this now without having to update anywhere else in the program

SECTION .text
global  _start

_start:

    mov     ebx, msg        ; move the address of our message string into EBX
    mov     eax, ebx        ; move the address in EBX into EAX as well (Both now point to the same segment in memory)

nextchar:
    cmp     byte [eax], 0   ; compare the byte pointed to by EAX at this address against zero (Zero is an end of string delimiter)
    jz      finished        ; jump (if the zero flagged has been set) to the point in the code labeled 'finished'
    inc     eax             ; increment the address in EAX by one byte (if the zero flagged has NOT been set)
    jmp     nextchar        ; jump to the point in the code labeled 'nextchar'

finished:
    sub     eax, ebx        ; subtract the address in EBX from the address in EAX
                            ; remember both registers started pointing to the same address (see line 15)
                            ; but EAX has been incremented one byte for each character in the message string
                            ; when you subtract one memory address from another of the same type
                            ; the result is number of segments between them - in this case the number of bytes

    mov     edx, eax        ; EAX now equals the number of bytes in our string
    mov     ecx, msg        ; the rest of the code should be familiar now
    mov     ebx, 1
    mov     eax, 4
    int     80h

    mov     ebx, 0
    mov     eax, 1
    int     80h
```

```
~$ nasm -f elf helloworld-len.asm
~$ ld -m elf_i386 helloworld-len.o -o helloworld-len
~$ ./helloworld-len
Hello, brave new world!
```
