## Lesson 14

#### Calculator - multiplication


In this program we will be multiplying the value in EBX by the value present in EAX.  Firstly we load EAX and EBX with integers in the same way as Lesson 12.  This time though we will be calling the MUL instruction to perform our multiplication logic.  The MUL instruction is different from many instructions in NASM, in that it only accepts one further argument.  The MUL instruction always multiples EAX by whatever value is passed after it.  The answer is left in EAX.

calculator-multiplication.asm
```asm
; Calculator (Multiplication)
; Compile with: nasm -f elf calculator-multiplication.asm
; Link with (64 bit systems require elf_i386 option): ld -m elf_i386 calculator-multiplication.o -o calculator-multiplication
; Run with: ./calculator-multiplication

%include        'functions.asm'

SECTION .text
global  _start

_start:

    mov     eax, 90     ; move our first number into eax
    mov     ebx, 9      ; move our second number into ebx
    mul     ebx         ; multiply eax by ebx
    call    iprintLF    ; call our integer print with linefeed function

    call    quit
```

```
~$ nasm -f elf calculator-multiplication.asm
~$ ld -m elf_i386 calculator-multiplication.o -o calculator-multiplication
~$ ./calculator-multiplication
