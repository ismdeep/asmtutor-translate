## Lesson 6

#### NULL terminating bytes

Ok so why did our second message print twice when we only called our sprint function on msg2 once?  Well actually it did only print once.  You can see what I mean if you comment out our second call to sprint.  The output will be both of our message strings.

But how is this possible?

What is happening is we weren't properly terminating our strings.  In assembly, variables are stored one after another in memory so the last byte of our msg1 variable is right next to the first byte of our msg2 variable.  We know our string length calculation is looking for a zero byte so unless our msg2 variable starts with a zero byte it keeps counting as if it's the same string (and as far as assembly is concerned it is the same string).  So we need to put a zero byte or 0h after our strings to let assembly know where to stop counting.

Note:
In programming 0h denotes a null byte and a null byte after a string tells assembly where it ends in memory.

helloworld-inc.asm
```asm
; Hello World Program (NULL terminating bytes)
; Compile with: nasm -f elf helloworld-inc.asm
; Link with (64 bit systems require elf_i386 option): ld -m elf_i386 helloworld-inc.o -o helloworld-inc
; Run with: ./helloworld-inc

%include        'functions.asm'

SECTION .data
msg1    db      'Hello, brave new world!', 0Ah, 0h          ; NOTE the null terminating byte
msg2    db      'This is how we recycle in NASM.', 0Ah, 0h  ; NOTE the null terminating byte

SECTION .text
global  _start

_start:

    mov     eax, msg1
    call    sprint

    mov     eax, msg2
    call    sprint

    call    quit
```

```
~$ nasm -f elf helloworld-inc.asm
~$ ld -m elf_i386 helloworld-inc.o -o helloworld-inc
~$ ./helloworld-inc
Hello, brave new world!
This is how we recycle in NASM.
```
