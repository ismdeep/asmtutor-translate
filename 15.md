    ## Lesson 15

    #### Calculator - division
</header>

In this program we will be dividing the value in EBX by the value present in EAX.  We've used division before in our integer print subroutine. Our program requires a few extra strings in order to print out the correct answer but otherwise there's nothing complicated going on.

Firstly we load EAX and EBX with integers in the same way as Lesson 12.  Division logic is performed using the DIV instruction.  The DIV instruction always divides EAX by the value passed after it.  It will leave the quotient part of the answer in EAX and put the remainder part in EDX (the original data register).  We then MOV and call our strings and integers to print out the correct answer.

calculator-division.asm
```asm
; Calculator (Division)
; Compile with: nasm -f elf calculator-division.asm
; Link with (64 bit systems require elf_i386 option): ld -m elf_i386 calculator-division.o -o calculator-division
; Run with: ./calculator-division

%include        'functions.asm'

SECTION .data
msg1        db      ' remainder '      ; a message string to correctly output result

SECTION .text
global  _start

_start:

    mov     eax, 90     ; move our first number into eax
    mov     ebx, 9      ; move our second number into ebx
    div     ebx         ; divide eax by ebx
    call    iprint      ; call our integer print function on the quotient
    mov     eax, msg1   ; move our message string into eax
    call    sprint      ; call our string print function
    mov     eax, edx    ; move our remainder into eax
    call    iprintLF    ; call our integer printing with linefeed function

    call    quit
```


```
~$ nasm -f elf calculator-division.asm
~$ ld -m elf_i386 calculator-division.o -o calculator-division
~$ ./calculator-division
10 remainder 0
```
