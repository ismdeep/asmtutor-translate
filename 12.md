#### 计算器 - 加法

In this program we will be adding the registers EAX and EBX together and we'll leave our answer in EAX. Firstly we use the MOV instruction to load EAX with an integer (in this case 90).  We then MOV an integer into EBX (in this case 9).  Now all we need to do is use the ADD instruction to perform our addition. EBX & EAX will be added together leaving our answer in the left most register in this instruction (in our case EAX). Then all we need to do is call our integer printing function to complete the program.

calculator-addition.asm
```asm
; Calculator (Addition)
; Compile with: nasm -f elf calculator-addition.asm
; Link with (64 bit systems require elf_i386 option): ld -m elf_i386 calculator-addition.o -o calculator-addition
; Run with: ./calculator-addition

%include        'functions.asm'

SECTION .text
global  _start

_start:

    mov     eax, 90     ; move our first number into eax
    mov     ebx, 9      ; move our second number into ebx
    add     eax, ebx    ; add ebx to eax
    call    iprintLF    ; call our integer print with linefeed function

    call    quit
```

```
~$ nasm -f elf calculator-addition.asm
~$ ld -m elf_i386 calculator-addition.o -o calculator-addition
~$ ./calculator-addition
99
```
