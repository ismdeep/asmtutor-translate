#### 传递参数


Passing arguments to your program from the command line is as easy as popping them off the stack in NASM. When we run our program, any passed arguments are loaded onto the stack in reverse order.  The name of the program is then loaded onto the stack and lastly the total number of arguments is loaded onto the stack. The last two stack items for a NASM compiled program are always the name of the program and the number of passed arguments.

So all we have to do to use them is pop the number of arguments off the stack first, then iterate once for each argument and perform our logic. In our program that means calling our print function.

Note:
We are using the ECX register as our counter for the loop. Although it's a general-purpose register it's original intention was to be used as a counter.

helloworld-args.asm
```asm
; Hello World Program (Passing arguments from the command line)
; Compile with: nasm -f elf helloworld-args.asm
; Link with (64 bit systems require elf_i386 option): ld -m elf_i386 helloworld-args.o -o helloworld-args
; Run with: ./helloworld-args

%include        'functions.asm'

SECTION .text
global  _start

_start:

    pop     ecx             ; first value on the stack is the number of arguments

nextArg:
    cmp     ecx, 0h         ; check to see if we have any arguments left
    jz      noMoreArgs      ; if zero flag is set jump to noMoreArgs label (jumping over the end of the loop)
    pop     eax             ; pop the next argument off the stack
    call    sprintLF        ; call our print with linefeed function
    dec     ecx             ; decrease ecx (number of arguments left) by 1
    jmp     nextArg         ; jump to nextArg label

noMoreArgs:
    call    quit
```

```
~$ nasm -f elf helloworld-args.asm
~$ ld -m elf_i386 helloworld-lf.o -o helloworld-args
~$ ./helloworld-args "This is one argument" "This is another" 101
./helloworld-args
This is one argument
This is another
101
```
