Introduction to how NASM handles namespace when it comes to global and local labels.

## Lesson 17

#### Namespace


Namespace is a necessary construct in any software project that involves a codebase that is larger than a few simple functions.  Namespace provides scope to your identifiers and allows you to reuse naming conventions to make your code more readable and maintainable.  In assembly language where subroutines are identified by global labels, namespace can be achieved by using local labels.

Up until the last few tutorials we have been using global labels exclusively.  This means that blocks of logic that essentially perform the same task needed a label with a unique identifier.  A good example would be our "finished" labels.  These were global in scope meaning when we needed to break out of a loop in one function we could jump to a "finished" label.  But if we needed to break out of a loop in a different function we would need to name this same task something else maybe calling it "done" or "continue". Being able to reuse the label "finished" would mean that someone reading the code would know that these blocks of logic perform almost the same task.

Local labels are prepended with a "." at the beginning of their name for example ".finished". You may have noticed them appearing as our code base in functions.asm grew.  A local label is given the namespace of the first global label above it. You can jump to a local label by using the JMP instruction and the compiler will calculate which local label you are referencing by determining in what scope (based on the above global labels) the instruction was called.

namespace.asm
```asm
; Namespace
; Compile with: nasm -f elf namespace.asm
; Link with (64 bit systems require elf_i386 option): ld -m elf_i386 namespace.o -o namespace
; Run with: ./namespace

%include        'functions.asm'

SECTION .data
msg1        db      'Jumping to finished label.', 0h        ; a message string
msg2        db      'Inside subroutine number: ', 0h        ; a message string
msg3        db      'Inside subroutine "finished".', 0h     ; a message string

SECTION .text
global  _start

_start:

subrountineOne:
    mov     eax, msg1       ; move the address of msg1 into eax
    call    sprintLF        ; call our string printing with linefeed function
    jmp     .finished       ; jump to the local label under the subrountineOne scope

.finished:
    mov     eax, msg2       ; move the address of msg2 into eax
    call    sprint          ; call our string printing function
    mov     eax, 1          ; move the value one into eax (for subroutine number one)
    call    iprintLF        ; call our integer printing function with linefeed function

subrountineTwo:
    mov     eax, msg1       ; move the address of msg1 into eax
    call    sprintLF        ; call our string print with linefeed function
    jmp     .finished       ; jump to the local label under the subrountineTwo scope

.finished:
    mov     eax, msg2       ; move the address of msg2 into eax
    call    sprint          ; call our string printing function
    mov     eax, 2          ; move the value two into eax (for subroutine number two)
    call    iprintLF        ; call our integer printing function with linefeed function

    mov     eax, msg1       ; move the address of msg1 into eax
    call    sprintLF        ; call our string printing with linefeed function
    jmp     finished        ; jump to the global label finished

finished:
    mov     eax, msg3       ; move the address of msg3 into eax
    call    sprintLF        ; call our string printing with linefeed function
    call    quit            ; call our quit function
```

```
~$ nasm -f elf namespace.asm
~$ ld -m elf_i386 namespace.o -o namespace
~$ ./namespace
Jumping to finished label.
Inside subroutine number: 1
Jumping to finished label.
Inside subroutine number: 2
Jumping to finished label.
Inside subroutine "finished".
