#### User input

##### Introduction to the .bss section

So far we've used the .text and .data section so now it's time to introduce the .bss section. BSS stands for Block Started by Symbol.  It is an area in our program that is used to reserve space in memory for uninitialised variables. We will use it to reserve some space in memory to hold our user input since we don't know how many bytes we'll need to store.

The syntax to declare variables is as follows:

.bss section example
```asm
SECTION .bss
variableName1:      RESB    1       ; reserve space for 1 byte
variableName2:      RESW    1       ; reserve space for 1 word
variableName3:      RESD    1       ; reserve space for 1 double word
variableName4:      RESQ    1       ; reserve space for 1 double precision float (quad word)
variableName5:      REST    1       ; reserve space for 1 extended precision float
```

##### Writing our program

We will be using the system call sys_read to receive and process input from the user. This function is assigned OPCODE 3 in the Linux System Call Table. Just like sys_write this function also takes 3 arguments which will be loaded into EDX, ECX and EBX before requesting a software interrupt that will call the function.

The arguments passed are as follows:

* EDX will be loaded with the maximum length (in bytes) of the our space in memory.
* ECX will be loaded with the address of our variable created in the .bss section.
* EBX will be loaded with the file we want to write to â€“ in this case STDIN.
                            As always the datatype and meaning of the arguments passed can be found in the function's definition.

When sys_read detects a linefeed, control returns to the program and the users input is located at the memory address you passed in ECX.

helloworld-input.asm
```asm
; Hello World Program (Getting input)
; Compile with: nasm -f elf helloworld-input.asm
; Link with (64 bit systems require elf_i386 option): ld -m elf_i386 helloworld-input.o -o helloworld-input
; Run with: ./helloworld-input

%include        'functions.asm'

SECTION .data
msg1        db      'Please enter your name: ', 0h      ; message string asking user for input
msg2        db      'Hello, ', 0h                       ; message string to use after user has entered their name

SECTION .bss
sinput:     resb    255                                 ; reserve a 255 byte space in memory for the users input string

SECTION .text
global  _start

_start:

    mov     eax, msg1
    call    sprint

    mov     edx, 255        ; number of bytes to read
    mov     ecx, sinput     ; reserved space to store our input (known as a buffer)
    mov     ebx, 0          ; write to the STDIN file
    mov     eax, 3          ; invoke SYS_READ (kernel opcode 3)
    int     80h

    mov     eax, msg2
    call    sprint

    mov     eax, sinput     ; move our buffer into eax (Note: input contains a linefeed)
    call    sprint          ; call our print function

    call    quit
